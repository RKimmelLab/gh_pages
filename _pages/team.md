**Research Interests**
**Pancreatic Islet Morphogenesis.** During pancreas development,
endocrine progenitors emerge as single cells and progressively
coalesce to form mature islets. We use zebrafish as a model for
examining islet morphogenesis in vivo with subcellular resolution. Our
goal is to define the process of islet assembly and identify molecular
mediators.

**Glucose regulation.**  Therapeutic intervention in diabetes aims to enhance beta cell function
and survival. We utilize novel transgenic reporter lines for following metabolic processes, in
combination with our diabetic zebrafish model. We explore how hyperglycemia and beta cells
are impacted by candidate pharmacologic interventions, through assessing physiological
parameters, oxidative stress and mitochondrial changes.

**Long term impact of disrupted glucose homeostasis.**  We use zebrafish diabetes models to
investigate tissue-specific organ pathologies, particularly changes in the retina, and
mechanisms leading to diabetic retinopathy. Imaging studies are combined with gene
expression analyses, looking at larval as well as adult stages.

**Advanced nanoparticles for imaging applications.** In the collaborative project **SWIMMOT**
(Switchable magneto-plasmonic contrast agents and molecular imaging technologies),
advanced nanoparticle contrast agents are being developed for imaging disease
pathophysiology.  Funding: **(Horizon 2020 – FET OPEN)**
